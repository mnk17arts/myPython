# Face Recognition Project üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## About this project ‚ÑπÔ∏è
> In this project, a face is detected from the camera source (given one) and compares it with the faces (images), which are stored in the Image File.  It can be used for taking "Attendance" using Face Recognition. For that firstly we have to store Images(faces) all the attendees.

> ### explanation:
+ all images are in BGR format, so converted in RGB
+ then we got face encodings of those images
- then we compare those face encodings of images(Image File) with face encodings of the image (face) from the webcam

**Note**: *Maximum one face is recognised in the testing image source at a time. If anyone can modify this code to recognise more than one, they are welcome!  mailto:mnk17arts@gmail.com*

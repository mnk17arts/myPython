which was shown by user's hand.

### Explanation:
If hand is tracked then
1. check status(1 or 0) of thumb
   * left hand...
     if x ordinate of thumb tip is less than that of pinky finger tip, then its left hand...else right hand
     if x ordinate of thumb tip is less than that of thumb ip, then thumb is open(appends 1)... else closed(0)
   * right hand...
     if x ordinate of thumb tip is less than that of thumb ip, then thumb is closed(0)... else opened(1)
2. check status of remaining fingers...
    if y ordinate of a finger tip is less than that of its pip, then that finger is open(1)... else closed(0)
3. through this status list recognise the number showed in input...

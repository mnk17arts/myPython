# Virtual Paint Project

In this project I have created a virtual paint project using OpenCv and other packages. We can draw on the Screen(out image) using
fingers(moving in the webcam viewport area). For drawing we use our index finger open. There are 5 different colors available in 
this project and an eraser to erase drawn work. For selection we use our index and  middle fingers open. We can even change the 
brush and rubber size through the changing values in the respected variables.

> Packages :  
+ cv2
+ numpy
+ time
+ os
+ HandTrackingModule.py

### Steps involved:
* import the image
- find hand landmarks
- check which fingers are up. SELECT when two fingers are up
- if selection mode - when two fingers are up... SELECT
- if drawing mode - index finger is up
